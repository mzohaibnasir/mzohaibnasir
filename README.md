**Senior ML/AI Engineering Leader** | Building production AI systems at scale

I architect and deploy enterprise AI systems that handle real money, real users, and real business problems. 6+ years turning research into revenue.

## What I Build

**Unlimit** (2024)  
AI + IoT cashierless retail system. 48+ camera feeds, real-time person tracking, Siamese network ReID across viewpoints, load cell sensor fusion. 24/7 unmanned store operations with sub-second latency. No humans, no checkout, no friction.

**Genesys & LabelRx** (2024)  
Multi-agent orchestration framework. COO agent coordinates CMO/CFO/Legal agents. 96% routing accuracy, 90%+ automation of routine ops, reduced CEO decision latency from days to 12 minutes. Built with LangGraph, BERT classification, Prophet forecasting, real-time Stripe + QuickBooks reconciliation.

**Althea AI** (2024)  
Voice-first multi-agent healthcare assistant. Ultravox fine-tuned model. 98% task completion, 600K+ minutes of staff time saved, 300K+ conversations, 60% cost reduction. QLoRA training, TensorRT inference at sub-100ms latency under concurrent load.

**KnowFace** (2022-2024)  
Digital KYC platform deployed at Zong and PayMax. Facial recognition, liveness detection, anti-spoofing, OCR. Serves millions of users. Built the entire pipeline from capture to core banking integration.

**Fleck-BVS** (2022-2024)  
Pakistan's first contactless four-finger biometric verification using standard smartphone cameras. Deployed at Jazz and Meezan Bank. Custom minutiae extraction, ML matching engine, anti-spoofing. No specialized hardware required.

I don't build demos. I build systems that ship.
